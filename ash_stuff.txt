--- Waiting sessions - AWR ASH
---
--- Good for when you know a spike has occurred for a particular wait event
--- and you want to get an overview of who the blocking sessions were. You
--- can drill into those further by uncommenting the session_id predicate
--- and specifying the relevent blocking sids.

--- The TM enqueue locks a structure from change and involves an exclusive
--- row level lock. A common cause of TM contention involves referential
--- integrity constraints. For example, a session inserts a new value into
--- a child table and then a second session wants to delete a row in the parent
--- This session only knows there is an outstanding change, it doesn't know
--- what the pending value is. Therefore, it has to wait so that there is
--- no chance of it changing the parent record and violating the constraint
--- Lengthy waits can occur when the change to the child table is left
--- uncommited for a long time, or there is no index on the child's foreign
--- key column so a full scan occurs when verifying the constraint.
---
--- The following query shows sessions waiting on the TM enqueue e.g. attempting
--- to modify the parent table, and also shows the child table being modified
--- by the blocker. The mode will be 4 when the blocked session is trying
--- to delete from the parent, and 3 when attempting to insert into the parent.
